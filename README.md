orthogonal automatons
=====================

A game in redux and react, with all the nice devtools.

running
=======

Install the deps and start the debug dev server:

    npm install
    npm start

Browse to the BoardPlay page for a debuggy rendering,
[http://localhost:3000/BoardPlay.html](http://localhost:3000/BoardPlay.html).

Hover automatons to see their possible moves! Press the 'Test populate' button
until the random number makes a nice board! Ponder how soon I'll need an 
artist!

todo
====

Browse to the [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) dev root 
for an approximation of playing the game on your own, when I finally implement it. Ahem.
